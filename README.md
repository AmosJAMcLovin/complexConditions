The following is my attempt at an assignmet written in html text/javascript code.

# Task 1: Create a Decision Table 
Create a decision table for a program where students grades are affected by their number of absences and or late assignments

# Task 2: Create a program for the decision table. 
Ask for the student’s name, current mark and number of absences and number of late assignments. 
Based in the grading scheme above, calculate the students grade. Then results taken and the student’s final grade to the screen. 
Note - the program will continually ask for a new student name until the user tells it to quit.
